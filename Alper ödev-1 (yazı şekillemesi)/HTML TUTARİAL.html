    <br>
    <br>
     <p><b>Hypertext Markup Language (HTML)</b>:
        is the standard markup language for creating web pages and web applications.
        <br>
        Web browsers receive <u>HTML</u> documents 
        from a web server or from local storage and render the documents into multimedia web pages. 
        <u>HTML</u> describes the structure of a web page 
        semantically and originally included cues for its appearance.
        <br>
        <br>
        <u>HTML</u> elements are the building blocks of <u>HTML</u> pages. With <u>HTML</u> constructs, 
        images and other objects such as interactive forms may be embedded into the rendered page. 
        <u>HTML</u> provides a means to create structured documents by denoting structural semantics for text such as 
        headings, paragraphs, lists, links, quotes, and other items. <u>HTML</u> elements are delineated by tags, written using angle brackets. 
        Tags such as <b>"img"</b> and<b>"input"</b>  directly introduce content into the page. 
        Other tags such as <b>"p"</b> and <b>"/p"</b> surround and provide information about document text and may include sub-element tags. 
        Browsers do not display the <u>HTML</u> tags but use them to interpret the content of the page.
        <br>
        <br>
        <p style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0) ; text-align: center;"><b>Markup</b></p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <u>HTML</u> markup consists of several key components, including those called tags (and their attributes), 
        character-based data types, character references and entity references. 
        <u>HTML</u> tags most commonly come in pairs like <b>"h1"</b> and <b>"/h1"</b> , 
        although some represent empty elements and so are unpaired, for example <b>"img"</b> . The first tag in such a pair is the start tag, 
        and the second is the end 
        tag (they are also called opening tags and closing tags).
        Another important component is the <u>HTML</u> document type declaration, which triggers standards mode rendering.
        The following is an example of the classic "Hello, World!" program:
        <br>
        <br>
        <img src="html hello world.jpg" alt="html" width="1000" height="250">

</body>
</html>
